## Hello, I’m Sakshi. :)

### About Me
Currently pursuing my *Masters in Computer Applications* (Class of '27) at SRM-IST, Trichy. I'm interested in projects on global welfare, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. Quantum Computing is the subject that has piqued my interest of recent and I hope to explore the same more. I am an active participant of WorldQuant University's Applied DS Lab - Completed 2 out of 8 projects in total so far and learned to build fundamental LR models, data cleaning, data preprocessing, visualizing and evaluating model performance. 

My other interests lie in the domains of neuroscience, mathematics, physics, psychology and bioinformatics which I hope to extensively contribute to in the future. 

Alongside programming projects, I'm also leading a self-growth club on campus [EQurated4U]. Our vision is cultivating a positive environment that ultimately leads to long-term personal and career success for our members and participants and we aim to achieve that through regular events being conducted on campus that focus on short-term habit accumulations and overcoming difficult hurdles by correcting subtle subconscious influence. 

Our first event, the **75-days consistency challenge**, garnered 30+ enthusiastic participants after a short-term online promotion. 

1. We collected updates on their habit completion through google forms.
2. We conducted regular Activity-of-the-day(s) with themes and quotes to enhance and keep spirits high and curious. 
3. By the end of December 2025, virtual activities were conducted to motivate the individual for 2026 with a 2025 Brain dump, 2026 Resolutions and Vision Board.

Reach out for queries, opportunities and collaborations, I'm 90-100% likely to accept and participate with high enthusiasm!
